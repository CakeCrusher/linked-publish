## Setup

### 1. `.env` setup.

1. Rename the `.env-template` file to `.env`.
2. Expose (deploy) this repository to the internet using through whatever means you prefer. I recommend [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). This link will be your `REDIRECT_URL`, you will need it for the following steps as well.

### 2. Create a LinkedIn App.

1. Create a LinkedIn developer account.
2. Create a [new app](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/apps).

3. Fill in the required fields (you will need a company page, you can set it up [here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/) if you don't have one).
4. Request access to all 3 products.

5. Navigate to "Auth". Add the "Client ID" and the "Client Secret" to the `.env` file accordingly. Add a redirect URL which will be your exposed root URL + `/api/auth`. "Update" the redirect URL.

### 3. Create a GitHub webhook on your repository.

1. Navigate to your repository's settings.

2. Navigate to "Webhooks".

3. Add a new webhook.

4. Set the "Payload URL" to your exposed root URL + `/api/publish`. "Add webhook" to submit.

### 4. linkedpush setup.

1. Navigate to your exposed root URL + `/api/auth-url`.
2. Sign in to LinkedIn and authorize the app.

### 5. You're set ðŸ¥³!

1. Simply commit with the `@linkedpush` string in the commit text (don't worry `@linkedpush` will be removed from the post text).
2. Push.
3. Your commit message will be transformed into a LinkedIn post!

## Troubleshooting

- Your token is stored in the server's memory, so if you restart the server, you will need to re-authorize the app.
- There are certain characters that are not allowed when posting via the API so the post will not go through. Here are some of them: `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, possibly more. The following characters are automatically removed by linkedpush so that the post goes through: `(`,`)`,`@`.
